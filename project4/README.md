## Project #4 - Release option for creating c8kv in GCP

Our team's script is used for creating a c8kv in Google Cloud. However, when release builds are created we do not have a way of tracking them.
The release option was added for internal and external use, but mostly for our internal records of being able to identify release builds once they were created. It is intended to introduce a script call option to identify the build as a release build, in which case a modified cli will be called to build the gcp image with the --license path included. 

## Technologies
The entire script is written in Bash.
