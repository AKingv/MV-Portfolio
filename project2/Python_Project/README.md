    My github repo consists of my MVP, final project, and examples of references I used to help me code. 

    I created a Single-Player Battleship game using only Python designed to be played in a terminal. The game follows the same rules as the traditional game. Ships will be assigned randomly throughout a map and a player is given turns or "missiles" to take out each ship. Once all battleships have been sunk then the game ends and player wins. The game has an added feature of allowing the user to select a difficulty to play.
