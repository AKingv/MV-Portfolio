## Project #1 - SpongeBob Recipe Book

The SpongeBob Recipe book is targetted for users looking for a simple and easy-to-navigate recipe application to either fill with fun recipes or even their own personal ones. The SpongeBob Recipe book allows users to create their own recipes and fully customize each if updates are needed. My team and I were inspired to create this application since many of us enjoy cooking, and found it a lot easier to create an application where we could easily navigate to our favorite recipes and quickly update it with any personal touches. I felt our most important feature is a user's ability to update or edit a recipe once it has been created. Sometimes when cooking we might want to add our own changes to a recipe we are using and instead of scribbling a note on the side of a recipe book, we can just add the update in our Recipe application.

## Technologies
- For the programming language in our project we only used Javascript
- Dependencies we used for our application are sequelize and sqlite3. We used node.js for our runtime environment and express.js for our framework.
- My group consisted of Jessica Rodrigues-Dlouhy, Addy Rodriquez, Deja Clarke, and myself.
