# Final Portfolio

This repository is a collection of some of my key learnings during my 2022 - 2023 apprenticeship at Cisco.

## Overview of Apprenticeship
- **Cisco**
- **September 2022 - December 2023**

## Portfolio Introduction
- I am Ariella King, a software engineering apprentice with a background in Cyber Security.
- I decided to pursue software engineering because I enjoy being challenged and doing problem solving. I love environments that are constantly changing because they allow for the opportunity to always learn and do more. Coding will never be obsolete or dull, thus providing an ever growing career.
- During my Cisco apprenticeship, I worked on the C8KV (catalyst 8000V) cloud team providing assistance with c8kv features and AWS P0 automation testing.
- I am interested in network programming using Python and Bash. I enjoyed the work I performed on my team and would continue to pursue coding for network devices.
